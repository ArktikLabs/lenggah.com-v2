        "We understand the frustration of working with custom services that feel one-sided. Often, they only take your brief and, if the result isn't what you hoped for, the responsibility falls entirely on you. That's why we approach things differently. From the very first idea to the moment your custom chair is ready, we walk alongside you, exploring possibilities and discussing options together. We see ourselves as your design companion, making sure every choice fits your style, your space, and the way you live.",
        "We begin by understanding what inspires you. Whether it's a moodboard, a quick sketch, or just a feeling you want your space to have, we listen and explore your vision together. Then, we actively reach out to share tailored ideas, discuss options, and guide you step by step. If you'd like to dive deeper, we can arrange a relaxed online design session to brainstorm and refine the details together.",
        "Every detail, from the model to the fabric to the finish is considered together. We blend your ideas with our experience to make choices that are thoughtful, practical, and beautiful. Every step is collaborative, so the final piece reflects your taste and your space perfectly.",
        "Each chair is handcrafted to order, designed to combine personality with functionality. The result is a bespoke piece that fits your home, reflects your lifestyle, and turns everyday moments into something meaningful. With us by your side, creating a chair is not just about designâ€”it's about shaping something personal and made just for you.",
